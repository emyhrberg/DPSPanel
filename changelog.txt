(v0.5)
- Fixed damage calculation issue where old instances of weapons (e.g minions) would only count towards the newest damage source instead of its own.
- Fixed issue where Eater of Worlds was not tracked properly.
- Fixed issue where other worm bosses were not tracked properly (e.g The Destroyer).
